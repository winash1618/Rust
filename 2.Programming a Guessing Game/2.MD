# Programming a Guessing Game
- We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

## Breaking down the Guessing Game
### Processing a Guess
- The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll allow the player to input a guess. 
```rust
use std::io; // This command bring the io input/output library into scope

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new(); // creating a mutable variable to store the user input.

    io::stdin() 
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line"); // expect is to handle the potential failure.

    println!("You guessed: {guess}"); // This will print the value in guess
}
```
- By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude.
- If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a 'use' statement.
- **In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won't change.**
- For example:
```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```
- **In Rust references are immutable by default.**
- Printing Values with println! Placeholders:
```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
```
### Generating a Secret Number
-  Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a rand crate with said functionality.
- **Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files.**
- Before we can write code that uses rand, we need to modify the Cargo.toml file to include the rand crate as a dependency.
- Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.
- Updating a Crate to Get a New Version: **cargo update**
### Generating a Random Number
```rust
 let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```
- we call the rand::thread_rng function that gives us the particular random number generator that we’re going to use.
- The gen_range method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a random number in the range. The kind of range expression we’re using here takes the form start..=end and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we need to specify 1..=100 to request a number between 1 and 100.
